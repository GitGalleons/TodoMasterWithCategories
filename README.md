- **Save Today's Work**: Save the current task list as a log entry for the day.
- **Previous Logs**: View and load previous logs, with the ability to delete them.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean, neon-themed interface with a sidebar, built using Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks and logs are saved in the browser's localStorage.
